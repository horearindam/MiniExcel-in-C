MiniExcel is what happens when you get tired of bloated spreadsheet software trying to cosplay as an operating system.

It’s a spreadsheet engine that remembers what spreadsheets were supposed to be: obedient, fast, and invisible.

No cloud theatrics.
No modal labyrinths.
No “sign in to edit a number.”

Just files. Just data. Just logic.

MiniExcel treats spreadsheets the way a compiler treats source code - as structured input, not as a lifestyle choice. You hand it a file, it gives you clean rows, typed values, and predictable output. It loads huge sheets without begging for RAM, writes results without breaking formulas, and walks away without leaving background processes haunting your machine.

Under the hood it’s doing quiet, unglamorous hero work:
- Streaming instead of hoarding memory
- Parsing instead of guessing
- Treating Excel as data, not drama

It’s the kind of tool that disappears into pipelines, ETL jobs, test harnesses, and batch processors — the places where real systems live, far away from shiny dashboards and subscription pop-ups.

MiniExcel doesn’t try to be your spreadsheet.
It tries to be your spreadsheet’s nervous system.

A clean nerve. Fast reflexes. No attitude.

Spreadsheets stop being “documents.”
They become data streams again.

Which is exactly how the 90s would’ve done it - if they’d had your RAM and better coffee.
